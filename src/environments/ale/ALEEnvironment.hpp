//two cases may arise either the features can be binary, or they can be general (doubles,...)
//There are two possible interfaces for the active features: either we return only the indices of the active features, or we return the indices and the corresponding feature value.
//For speed purposes, the features computer working with binary features are required to provide the first interface.

//we call the macro to create the member detector
CREATE_MEMBER_DETECTOR(getActiveFeaturesIndices)
